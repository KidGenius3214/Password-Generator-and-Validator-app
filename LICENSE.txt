I wrote the code which makes my app work.But the code used to make the GUI and other functions were from the modules
Kivy and Kivymd which use sdl2, glew, pygments, docutils which were not written by me. They are dependencies which are needed by kivy and kivymd to work.
These dependecies may be copyrighted, so to confirm, I did not write the code to for those programs/dependencies
If you are not satisfied with this license, please consult me before taking any legal action, I will gladly take down the app
